Fully compatible with existing Cookiecutter templates. Creating new projects from templates using cruft is easy: And, so is updating them as the template changes overtime: Many project template utilities exist that automate the copying and pasting of code to create new projects. This seems great! However, once created, most leave you with that copy-and-pasted code to manage through the life of your project. cruft is different. It automates the creation of new projects like the others, but then it also helps you to manage the boilerplate through the life of the project. cruft makes sure your code stays in-sync with the template it came from for you. Key Features: Cookiecutter Compatible : cruft utilizes Cookiecutter as its template expansion engine. Meaning it retains full compatibility with all existing Cookiecutter templates. Template Validation : cruft can quickly validate whether or not a project is using the latest version of a template using cruft check . This check can easily be added to CI pipelines to ensure your projects stay in-sync. Automatic Template Updates : cruft automates the process of updating code to match the latest version of a template, making it easy to utilize template improvements across many projects. Installation: To get started - install cruft using a Python package manager: pip3 install cruft OR poetry add cruft OR pipenv install cruft Creating a New Project: To create a new project using cruft run cruft create PROJECT_URL from the command line. For example: cruft create https : // github . com / timothycrosley / cookiecutter - python / cruft will then ask you any necessary questions to create your new project. It will use your answers to expand the provided template, and then return the directory it placed the expanded project. Behind the scenes, cruft uses Cookiecutter to do the project expansion. The only difference in the resulting output is a .cruft.json file that contains the git hash of the template used as well as the parameters specified. Updating a Project To update an existing project, that was created using cruft, run cruft update in the root of the project. If there are any updates, cruft will have you review them before applying. If you accept the changes cruft will apply them to your project and update the .cruft.json file for you. Tip Sometimes certain files just aren't good fits for updating. Such as test cases or __init__ files. You can tell cruft to always skip updating these files on a project by project basis by added them to a skip section within your .cruft.json file: { \"template\" : \"https://github.com/timothycrosley/cookiecutter-python\" , \"commit\" : \"8a65a360d51250221193ed0ec5ed292e72b32b0b\" , \"skip\" : [ \"cruft/__init__.py\" , \"tests\" ], ... } Or, if you have toml installed, you can add skip files directly to a tool.cruft section of your pyproject.toml file: [tool.cruft] skip = [\"cruft/__init__.py\", \"tests\"] Checking a Project Checking to see if a project is missing a template update is as easy as running cruft check . If the project is out-of-date an error and exit code 1 will be returned. cruft check can be added to CI pipelines to ensure projects don't unintentionally drift. Linking an Existing Project Have an existing project that you created from a template in the past using Cookiecutter directly? You can link it to the template that was used to create it using: cruft link TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY . For example: cruft link https : // github . com / timothycrosley / cookiecutter - python / You can then specify the last commit of the template the project has been updated to be consistent with, or accept the default of using the latest commit from the template. Why Create cruft? Since I first saw videos of quickly being used to automate Ubuntu application creation, I've had a love/hate relationship with these kinds of tools. I've used them for many projects and certainly seen them lead to productivity improvements. However, I've always felt like they were a double-edged sword. Sure, they would automate away the copying and pasting many would do to create projects. However, by doing so, they encouraged more code to be copied and pasted! Then, over time, you could easily be left with hundreds of projects that contained copy-and-pasted code with no way to easy way to update them. I created cruft to be a tool that recognized that balance between project creation and maintenance and provided mechanisms to keep built projects up-to-date. I hope you too find cruft useful! ~Timothy Crosley","title":"Home"},{"location":"#key-features","text":"Cookiecutter Compatible : cruft utilizes Cookiecutter as its template expansion engine.

Optionally, projects that use Hug are encouraged to follow this HOPE and link to it as a reference. PEP 8 Foundation All guidelines in this document are in addition to those defined in Python's PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines. Line Length Too short of lines discourage descriptive variable names where they otherwise make sense. Too long of lines reduce overall readability and make it hard to compare 2 files side by side. There is no perfect number: but for Hug, we've decided to cap the lines at 100 characters. Descriptive Variable names Naming things is hard. Hug has a few strict guidelines on the usage of variable names, which hopefully will reduce some of the guesswork: - No one character variable names. - Except for x, y, and z as coordinates. - It's not okay to override built-in functions. - Except for id . Guido himself thought that shouldn't have been moved to the system module. It's too commonly used, and alternatives feel very artificial. - Avoid Acronyms, Abbreviations, or any other short forms - unless they are almost universally understand. Adding new modules New modules added to the a project that follows the HOPE-8 standard should all live directly within the base PROJECT_NAME/ directory without nesting. If the modules are meant only for internal use within the project, they should be prefixed with a leading underscore. For example, def _internal_function. Modules should contain a docstring at the top that gives a general explanation of the purpose and then restates the project's use of the MIT license. There should be a tests/test_$MODULE_NAME.py file created to correspond to every new module that contains test coverage for the module. Ideally, tests should be 1:1 (one test object per code object, one test method per code method) to the extent cleanly possible. Automated Code Cleaners All code submitted to Hug should be formatted using Black and isort. Black should be run with the line length set to 100, and isort with Black compatible settings in place.

Our Pledge In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Scope This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting timothy.crosley@gmail.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Confidentiality will be maintained with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership. Attribution This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][https://www.contributor-covenant.org], version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq","title":"3.
